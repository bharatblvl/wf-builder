# CrewAI Dashboard Guide

## Overview

The CrewAI Dashboard is a Streamlit-based interface that provides a visual way to manage and run code generated by your CrewAI agents and tasks.

## Features

- **Agent-Task Cards**: Visual cards grouped by agents showing all tasks
- **Status Indicators**: See which tasks have generated code (✅ Generated) vs pending (⏳ Pending)
- **Run Generated Code**: Click "▶️ Run" to view instructions and run generated Streamlit applications
- **View Code**: Click "👁️ View" to see the generated code and download it
- **Statistics**: Sidebar shows statistics about total tasks and completion status

## Usage

### 1. Start the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### 2. Generate Code

First, generate code using the CrewAI application:

```bash
python crew_app.py
```

This will:
- Read agents and tasks from `config/agents.yaml` and `config/tasks.yaml`
- Execute the tasks using Claude Sonnet
- Save generated code to `generated_code/` directory with naming: `{agent_name}_{task_name}.py`
- Create metadata tracking in `generated_code/metadata.json`

### 3. View and Run Generated Code

1. **View Tasks**: The dashboard displays all tasks grouped by their assigned agents
2. **Check Status**: 
   - ✅ Green badge = Code has been generated
   - ⏳ Yellow badge = Code not yet generated
3. **Run Code**: 
   - Click "▶️ Run" button on a task card
   - Follow the instructions shown to run the generated Streamlit app in a new terminal
4. **View Code**: 
   - Click "👁️ View" button to see the generated Python code
   - Download the code file if needed

### 4. Run Generated Applications

When you click "▶️ Run", the dashboard will show you:

1. **Run Instructions Tab**: 
   - Command to run: `streamlit run "path/to/generated_code/file.py"`
   - Copy this command and run it in a new terminal

2. **View Code Tab**: 
   - Full source code of the generated application
   - Download button to save the code

3. **Settings Tab**: 
   - Metadata about the generated code
   - File size and generation timestamp

## File Structure

```
wf-builder/
├── dashboard.py              # Streamlit dashboard interface
├── crew_app.py              # CrewAI application that generates code
├── config/
│   ├── agents.yaml          # Agent configurations
│   └── tasks.yaml           # Task configurations
└── generated_code/          # Directory for generated code
    ├── metadata.json        # Metadata about generated files
    └── {agent}_{task}.py    # Generated code files
```

## Dashboard Layout

- **Header**: Title and description
- **Sidebar**: 
  - Filters (Show All, Generated Only, Pending Only)
  - Statistics (Total Tasks, Generated, Pending)
- **Main Area**: 
  - Agent cards (purple gradient)
  - Task cards (white with status indicators)
  - Run/View expandable sections

## Tips

- **Multiple Tasks**: If you have multiple tasks, each will appear as a separate card
- **Multiple Agents**: Tasks are grouped by their assigned agent
- **Filters**: Use sidebar filters to show only generated or pending tasks
- **Code Regeneration**: Delete generated files and rerun `crew_app.py` to regenerate

## Troubleshooting

- **No Tasks Showing**: Check that `config/tasks.yaml` and `config/agents.yaml` exist and are valid YAML
- **Code Not Found**: Make sure you've run `python crew_app.py` to generate code first
- **Dashboard Not Loading**: Ensure Streamlit is installed: `pip install streamlit`
