    Create a complete Streamlit application with the following requirements:

    1. **Page Structure:**
       - A professional header section at the top of the page
       - A footer section at the bottom of the page
       - Main content area in between

    2. **Functionality:**
       - Accept transaction data (either through file upload or manual input)
       - Analyze transactions to detect fraudulent activity
       - Use OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo (GPT mini) as the LLM to power the fraud detection analysis
       - Display results showing which transactions are fraudulent and which are legitimate
       - Provide clear visual indicators (colors, badges, etc.) to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions

    3. **Technical Requirements:**
       - Use Streamlit best practices
       - Include proper error handling
       - Add loading states for LLM API calls
       - Make the UI modern and user-friendly
       - Include data validation
       - Support CSV file uploads for transaction data
       - Display transaction data in a table format
       - Show analysis results with explanations from the LLM

    4. **Code Quality:**
       - Well-commented code
       - Modular structure
       - Include environment variable configuration for API keys
       - Add requirements.txt dependencies
       - Follow Python PEP 8 standards

    Generate the complete Streamlit application code as a single, runnable file. Include all necessary imports, configuration, and helper functions.
  agent: "streamlit_code_agent"
  expected_output: "A complete, production-ready Streamlit application code file that can be run directly. The code should be well-structured, commented, and include all necessary functionality for transaction fraud detection using OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo."
